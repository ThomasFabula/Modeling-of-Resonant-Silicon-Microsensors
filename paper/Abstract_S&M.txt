“This paper is concerned with the modeling of resonant silicon microsensors using analytical
as well as finite-element methods. In the case of simple resonator structures, ideal boundary
conditions and isotropic material properties, analytical methods can be used to model the 
dynamic behaviour of resonant microsensors. For more complex resonator structures, arbitrary 
boundary conditions, anisotropic material properties, multi-layer structures, and in the 
presence of coupled-field effects, the finite-element method is well suited for simulating
the behaviour of resonant microstructures. Beamlike force and diaphragm pressure sensors 
are used to demonstrate the capability of this method to calculate eigenfrequencies, mode 
shapes, load-dependent frequency changes and cross-sensitivities as well as to optimize
the resonator geometry with respect to mode selectivity, mode decoupling, electromechanical 
coupling efficiency, and measuring range and sensitivity. The numerical results are compared
to experimental data in order to verify the finite-element models.“
