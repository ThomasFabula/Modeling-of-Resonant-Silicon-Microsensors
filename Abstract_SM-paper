ABSTRACT

This document deals with the analytical and finite element modeling of resonant silicon microsensors for measuring forces and pressure.


Modeling of resonant microsensors

This work deals with the modeling of resonant silicon microsensors using analytical and finite element methods.
 
These methods enable the simulation of the dynamic behavior of complex resonator structures.
• Resonant sensors change their output frequency depending on the quantity to be measured.
• They offer high sensitivity, high resolution, and semi-digital outputs.
• They are manufactured using bulk micromachining technologies such as anisotropic wet etching and thin-film deposition.


Analytical and numerical methods

Analytical methods can be used for simple resonator structures, while complex structures require the finite element method.
• Analytical models are suitable for ideal boundary conditions and isotropic material properties.
• The finite element method is more suitable for complex resonators with arbitrary boundary conditions and anisotropic materials.
• Examples of complex resonators are butterfly resonators and beam-on-diaphragm structures.


Structure and function of microsensors

The general structure of a piezoelectrically operated resonant pressure or force microsensor is described.
• The resonant component consists of a silicon membrane or a beam.
• Piezoelectric thin films, such as zinc oxide (ZnO), are used to excite and detect the vibrations.
• The process involves structuring, doping, and etching to achieve the desired thickness.

Dynamic behavior of beam and membrane resonators

The dynamic behavior of double-clamped beams and membrane resonators clamped on all sides is analyzed.
• The vibration frequencies and mode shapes can be calculated analytically.
• For beams, a partial differential equation is used to describe the vertical displacements.
• The resonance frequencies depend on the geometry and material properties.

Limitations of analytical methods

Analytical solutions are only possible in special cases and have several limitations.
• Exact boundary conditions often cannot be taken into account.
• Anisotropic material properties and multilayer systems are difficult to model.
• The finite element method offers better flexibility and accuracy for complex problems.

Mathematical fundamentals of the finite element method

The mathematical fundamentals of the finite element method are explained, including the equations for elastic bodies.
• The equation of motion is derived using variational approaches.
• The weak formulation enables the numerical solution of complex problems.
• Finite element analysis requires the discretization of the model into finite elements.


Program implementation and nonlinear effects

The implementation of the finite element method in programs is described, including the consideration of nonlinear effects.
• The matrix equation for static analyses is presented.
• Geometric nonlinearities and stress stiffening must be taken into account.
• Dynamic electromechanical coupled analyses use special matrices for the interactions between mechanical and electrical fields.

Use of FEM for optimizing microsensors

The use of finite element methods (FEM) enables a significant reduction in the time required for the design and manufacture of microsensors
and provides insights into their mode of operation. FEM is particularly useful for modeling the dynamic response of resonant sensors
and for predicting their performance under operating conditions.
• FEM enables the analysis of resonance frequencies and modes of microsensors.
• Modeling helps optimize geometries, e.g., of clamping and decoupling regions.
• FEM is used for the development of multilayer structures such as piezoelectrically operated microsensors.


Natural frequencies and modes of pressure sensors

FEM was used to calculate the eigenvalues and modes of a resonant pressure sensor consisting of a square silicon membrane.

The results show a high degree of agreement between numerical, analytical, and experimental values.
• The pressure sensor has a thickness of 50 µm and side lengths of 9.2 mm.
• The resonance frequencies of the higher vibration modes deviate by less than 4% from the analytical results.
• The intrinsic stress in the ZnO layer was estimated to be approximately -15 MPa.


Load-dependent frequency changes

The deflection of the membrane due to pressure differences was calculated using nonlinear analyses taking into account stress stiffening 
and large deformations. Various FEM models were used to investigate the influence of material behavior and boundary conditions.
•    The resonance frequency of the sensor is 8317 Hz with a pressure sensitivity of 12.4 Hz/mbar.
•    Deviations between measured and calculated values are between 2-19%.
•    The deviations are due to intrinsic stresses and unknown material properties.


Thermal behavior of microsensors

Temperature changes strongly influence the properties of resonant microsensors, including the resonance frequency and the 
possibility of buckling. FEM models were used to characterize the temperature-dependent properties of resonant sensors.
• The critical temperature difference at which the membrane buckles is approximately 27 K.
• The maximum static deflection of the membrane was calculated to be 70-77 µm.
• Temperature compensation methods were investigated to reduce temperature sensitivity.


Piezoelectric excitation and efficiency

The efficiency of the conversion of electrical energy into mechanical energy is characterized by the effective electromechanical coupling factor (keff).
FEM analyses show significant deviations between calculated and measured values due to residual stresses in 
the ZnO layer.
• The maximum keff for ZnO is 0.22, while 0.38 is achieved for PZT.
• Deviations of up to 52% between calculated and measured values were found.
• Optimization of the keff is possible by selecting the optimal thickness ratio.


Optimization of resonators and modes

The optimization of resonant microsensors requires knowledge of their internal behavior, which is achieved through FEM models.
Various geometric configurations were investigated to improve the performance of the sensors.
• The resonance frequencies of the first three vibration modes were analyzed as a function of the length of the decoupling zone.
• Good mechanical decoupling can be achieved with a decoupling zone length of 200-300 µm.
• The pressure sensitivity varies between 0.5 kHz/bar and 11 kHz/bar depending on the side lengths and thickness of the membrane.
