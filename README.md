## Abstract
“This paper is concerned with the modeling of resonant silicon microsensors using analytical as well as finite-element methods. In the case of simple resonator structures, ideal boundary conditions and isotropic material properties, analytical methods can be used to model the dynamic behaviour of resonant microsensors. For more complex resonator structures, arbitrary boundary conditions, anisotropic material properties, multi-layer structures, and in the presence of coupled-field effects, the finite-element method is well suited for simulating the behaviour of resonant microstructures. Beamlike force and diaphragm pressure sensors are used to demonstrate the capability of this method to calculate eigenfrequencies, mode shapes, load-dependent frequency changes and cross-sensitivities as well as to optimize the resonator geometry with respect to mode selectivity, mode decoupling, electromechanical coupling efficiency, and measuring range and sensitivity. The numerical results are compared to experimental data in order to verify the finite-element models.“
